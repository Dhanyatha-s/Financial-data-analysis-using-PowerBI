##### 3.Gross Profit ($1.48M, 40.83%) remains strong, meaning the company retains a healthy portion of earnings after covering direct costs.  
##### 4.Expenses ($0.90M) are a notable factor reducing profitability.  
##### 5.Net Profit ($0.57M, 15.82%) is positive, confirming profitability, but the net profit margin is lower than the target, suggesting cost pressures.

##### A. Operational Profit Over Time Chart  
üîπ What is it?  
Operational profit refers to the earnings a company makes from its core business operations, excluding taxes and interest payments. This chart tracks how the company‚Äôs operational profit has changed over time, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis.  
üîπ What is it telling us?  
ÔÇ∑If the line is increasing, it means the business is making more money from its main operations.  
ÔÇ∑If the line is decreasing, it means operational costs may be increasing or sales revenue is declining.  
ÔÇ∑Fluctuations (ups and downs) could indicate seasonal effects or irregular business cycles.  
‚û°Ô∏è This chart helps stakeholders understand whether the company‚Äôs daily business activities are profitable before considering external costs like taxes and financing expenses.  

#### B. Net Profit Over Time Chart  
üîπ What is it?   
Net profit is the final amount the company earns after subtracting all expenses, including taxes, interest, and operational costs. It‚Äôs the true bottom-line measure of profitability.   
üîπ What is it telling us?   
ÔÇ∑If net profit is consistently positive and growing, the company is becoming more profitable.   
ÔÇ∑If it fluctuates, it suggests varying expenses, possibly due to high operational costs or external factors.  
ÔÇ∑If it is declining, the company is either spending too much or earning less revenue than before.   
‚û°Ô∏è This chart helps assess the overall health of the business. Even if operational profit is high, net profit may be low due to high external expenses.  

### C. Assets and Liabilities Chart  
üîπ What is it?  
Assets represent everything the company owns (cash, inventory, equipment, etc.), while liabilities are what the company owes (loans, debts, unpaid expenses).
üîπ What is it telling us?  
ÔÇ∑If assets are higher than liabilities, the company is financially stable.  
ÔÇ∑If liabilities are increasing, it means the company is borrowing more or delaying payments, which could be risky.  
ÔÇ∑A balance between assets and liabilities ensures financial security, while too much debt could be problematic.  
‚û°Ô∏è This chart is crucial for understanding the company's financial stability and ability to meet future financial obligations.  

#### D. General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses Chart  
üîπ What is it?  
G&A expenses include costs not directly related to production but necessary for running the business, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and office expenses.
üîπ What is it telling us?  
ÔÇ∑If G&A expenses are increasing, the company might be spending too much on administrative activities.  
ÔÇ∑If they are steady or decreasing, it means cost control is in place.  
ÔÇ∑High G&A expenses compared to revenue can reduce overall profitability.  
‚û°Ô∏è This chart helps determine whether the company is managing operational costs efficiently.
